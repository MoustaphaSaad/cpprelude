# CPPrelude

**CPPrelude** is a body of code that I tend to write over and over again in every project I make. So, I decided to write it as a library and include it in my projects.

It contains algorithms, containers, memory management stuff ... etc.

Developed by:

**[Moustapha Saad Abdel-hameed](moustapha.saad.abdelhamed@gmail.com)**

**CPPrelude** version 1.0 is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.
