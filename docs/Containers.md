# Containers

**CPPrelude** provide a number of different containers. here's a list of them

| Name                                | Description                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [array](array.md)                   | provide a wrapper around the static array that C++ provide by default. |
| [dynamic_array](dynamic_array.md)   | provide a contagious dynamic size array implementation. |
| [slinked_list](slinked_list.md)     | an implementation of a singly linked list. |
| [dlinked_list](dlinked_list.md)     | an implementation of doubly linked list. |
| [string](string.md)     | a string type. |
| [bucket_array](bucket_array.md)     | an implementation of a bucket array that allocates memory in buckets -not in nodes- and has the same interface as dlinked_list. |
| [quick_find](quick_find.md)         | an API that applies quick find algorithm to resolves dynamic connectivity problem. |
| [quick_union](quick_union.md)       | an API that applies quick union algorithm to resolves dynamic connectivity problem. |
| [priority_queue](priority_queue.md) | is a queue container that its first output is always the most important value in the container. It acts as a heap. By default it is a min-heap, but it can be set to max-heap by using comparator argument. |
|                                     |                                          |
|                                     |                                          |
|                                     |                                          |
